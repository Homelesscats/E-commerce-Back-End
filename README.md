## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need to use the [MySQL2Links](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [SequelizeLinks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize)packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to an external site. to use environment variables to store sensitive data, like your MySQL username, password, and database name.

Use the schema.sql file in the db folder to create your database using MySQL shell commands. Use environment variables to store sensitive data, like your MySQL username, password, and database name.
